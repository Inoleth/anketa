(node.js + express.js + socket.io)

Created an app for teachers where they can create a quiz for every lecture of a class and have students answer them in real time. There are many types of questions. There are anonymous and public quizzes, so that teachers can see the nicknames of the students that take the quiz or not. After the end of each question in a quiz, some graph charts are shown about how the students answered the question. Students can also ask questions about a particular class, write comments about the class and the teachers can answer them.
